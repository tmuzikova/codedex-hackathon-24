# Sip n' Play Revamped! (project made solo during Codédex Hackathon 07/2024)

deployed website: https://sipnplay-codedex.netlify.app/

This project was focused on making the existing page of a Boarg Game Cafe a bit more fun, responsive, SEO friendly and easy to use. Now, everything works perfectly for mobile users, the website is a bit simplified (e.g. navbar links) and you can easily and quickly find any needed information. I added some 3D designs to accompany the menu and also made a simple event calendar. I also rebranded the logo to match the 3D vibe of the new website nicely.

 Next steps may include: 

 - making the event calendar dynamic, fetching the data from somewhere else rather than simple JSON
 - creating custom 3D designs to match the menu items perfectly
 - adding the feedback form they have on the exsiting website
 - updating the design a bit more :)

The project was made using the following tech stack:
- React + JavaScript
- Bootstrap for styling
- Three.js for 3D images

Lessons learned :) 
- for the first time, I experienced coding under time pressure (and by myself!) as a full functioning website was needed to be made in less than 24 hours
- I played with Three.js for the first time (which was super fun but also a bit painful at the same time :D)
- It is really nice to have a Figma design and follow it during coding (I did not do it and freestyled the design which wasn't the best idea as it was all over the place at the beginning)
